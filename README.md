This repositry contains the source code for a Tumour Classification and Segmentation Project.
It consists of a neural network for classification and segmentation on breast cancer ultrasound scans in Jupyter Notebook using TensorFlow library.
It includes a classification model for predicting tumour types with CNNs & data augmentation and a segmentation model for binary tumour presence using U-Net-like architecture & residual connections.
Both models were trained with specific optimizers and evaluation metrics.
